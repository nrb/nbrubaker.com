      <description>After getting laid off [LINK], I was on the job hunt. Honestly, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what I was looking to do next. Maybe something not directly related to Kubernetes, maybe some sort of SaaS. I interviewed with a bunch of companies, got rejected by some, opted not to go very far with others, and ultimately had 3 offers to choose from.
My first was with a company that builds an open source &amp;ldquo;search engine database.</description>

      <title>What I Look For In A Company</title>

      <description>Hopefully, this page will help you get to know me a little better, and help us both judge if your company and I would be a good fit.
First and foremost, I seek to work at places and projects where I am a force multiplier: working on things that make others more effective or efficient. I want to help others work better. I feel most comfortable working on tools that help other developers, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t a hard requirement.</description>

      <description>Growing as a software engineer I&amp;rsquo;ve recently taken on my first tech lead role, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking time to reflect on what that means. I think a huge part of being a tech lead is growing your team, and recently I got the question, &amp;ldquo;How do I know what subject areas are available? What should I do in order to get promoted into more senior positions?&amp;rdquo;
My opinion is that a huge part of moving up in seniority is being able to deal with ambiguity.</description>
