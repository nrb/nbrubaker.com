      <description>Hopefully, this page will help you get to know me a little better, and help us both judge if your company and I would be a good fit.
First and foremost, I seek to work at places and projects where I am a force multiplier: working on things that make others more effective or efficient. I want to help others work better. I feel most comfortable working on tools that help other developers, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t a hard requirement.</description>
