Hopefully, this page will help you get to know me a little better, and help us both judge if your company and I would be a good fit.

First and foremost, I seek to work at places and projects where I am a **force multiplier**: working on things that make others more effective or efficient. I want to help others work better. I feel most comfortable working on tools that help other developers, but this isn't a hard requirement.

I also prefer companies that are **remote-friendly**. Physical location matters less for developers, and if a company can support multiple offices, it can support people working from anywhere. That said, I also acknowledge others might simply prefer working in an office environment, but that's not me.

Companies that **invest in and contribute to open source** are also preferable. Using open source software is well and good, but even better is to fix the problems where they occur. Bonus points if your company makes open source contributions easy to find, and makes room for developers to contribute upstream.

Similarly, **reducing tech debt** are awesome. Sometimes things aren't done perfectly because of deadlines or learning - that's ok! Delivering something is better than delaying eternally. By the same token, it is useful to revise code and process that makes adding new features difficult and therefore slow business momentum, rather than trying to power through.

Personally, I like **variety** in what I work on, but **not frequent context switching**. I work better if I change projects on the scale of weeks or days as opposed to changing projects every few hours. By the same token, I tend to get bored if I work on a single project for too long, so mobility within the company can help keep me there longer.

You can find my resume in [PDF](../resume.pdf) and [text](../resume.txt) formats. I have some [public projects](https://github.com/nrb/) on GitHub, and you can [see my activity with OpenStack](https://review.openstack.org/#/q/owner:%22Nolan+Brubaker+%253Cnolan.brubaker%2540rackspace.com%253E%22++or+reviewer:%22Nolan+Brubaker+%253Cnolan.brubaker%2540rackspace.com%253E%22) from the past.
