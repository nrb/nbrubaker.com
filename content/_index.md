# Nolan Brubaker
##### Software Developer

### A little about me

I'm a software developer with {{< yrs_exp >}} years of experience in the tech industry, across a variety of roles.

I've worked in nearly every capacity, from help desk, sales, network administration, database design, software engineering, and computer science research.  During that time, I have written many software systems, including business intelligence report systems, network simulators, web applications for various tasks, and operations tooling.

However, communicating the technical aspects of my work is incredibly important to me.  During my time in the industry, I've helped explain concepts from connecting to the Internet, deploying a network, or learning programming to all kinds of users, from high school students to CEOs.

### People I've worked with

 * [Eldarion](http://eldarion.com), creators of fine Django sites. They've also made [Gondor](http://gondo.io) a platform service for Django sites.
 * [Red Post](http://www.theredpost.com"), a digital signage platform targetting local audiences
 * [Cox Media Group](https://www.coxmediagroup.com/), a local media company. I helped maintain and expand Google DoubleClick for Publishers integration with their internal, Django-based CMS.
 * [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/), a cloud provider. I worked on the openstack-ansible and RPC-OpenStack projects, allowing for the creation and management of OpenStack private clouds.
 * [Heptio](https://www.heptio.com), a company founded around Kubernetes enablement. Heptio was made by the creators of Kubernetes in order to further build on its value for organizations. I joined as employee 40 and worked on Heptio Ark, a Kubernetes backup and recovery solution.
 * [VMware](https://www.vmware.com), an infrastructure software company. I worked on [Velero](https://velero.io) (formerly Heptio Ark), a Kubernetes backup and recovery solution, for several years, eventually becoming the project's technical lead. I also participated in the Tanzu Community Edition team, launching an open source Kubernetes distribution.

I'm interested in...

* Python, Go, and Rust
* Practicing Japanese
* Linux
* Video and board games
* Cycling
